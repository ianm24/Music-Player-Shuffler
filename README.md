# Music-Player-Shuffler
Shuffles music using the vlc library and custom made shuffler

This is a program I made earlier this year. (The completion dates of each of the programs are listed in the info.txt)
It takes songs from the music folder and can loop and/or shuffle them
The shuffle will never play a song twice in a row, even between loops.

The code used for testing and troubleshooting is put in a multiline comment and noted to be such code.

In the test folder there are two programs. 
1) In the 'Music Test' folder there is an example that plays music from its respective 'music' folder.
2) In the 'Shuffle' folder, there is a more easy to understand version of my custom made shuffler code using numbers in a list

The example music in the 'music' folders include Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley and 4 songs by my friend Dylan McDonagh from his album Dunham

All of the code was written by me in Python 2.7 using the VLC Python library.

I considered making a version of this with a GUI (and I may still do so if I get bored) but it would just be a worse version of VLC using the VLC library.

This was more of a practice in parsing files and using that information to do cool things.

Hope you all enjoy!
